# Off-Road Datasets for Autonomous Vehicles and Robotics

This repository contains a list of publicly available off-road datasets that can be used for research and development in autonomous vehicle navigation, terrain classification, and off-road robotics.

## Available Datasets

### 1. Yamaha-CMU Off-Road Dataset (YCOR)
- **Description:** Contains 1,076 images collected from four different locations in Western Pennsylvania and Ohio across three different seasons.
- **Labels:** Eight classes, including sky, rough trail, smooth trail, traversable grass, high vegetation, non-traversable low vegetation, and obstacles.
- **Access:** [Yamaha-CMU Off-Road Dataset](https://theairlab.org/yamaha-offroad-dataset/)

### 2. Off-Road Terrain for Autonomous Vehicles Dataset
- **Description:** Dataset with over 12,000 images captured using a monocular camera, along with sensor data from GPS, IMUs, and a wheel rotation speed sensor.
- **Labels:** Terrain roughness measured from IMU z-axis acceleration readings.
- **Access:** [Off-Road Terrain for Autonomous Vehicles](https://datasetninja.com/off-road-terrain-for-autonomous-vehicles)

### 3. ORFD: Off-Road Freespace Detection Dataset
- **Description:** Dataset with 12,198 LiDAR point cloud and RGB image pairs.
- **Labels:** Annotated with traversable, non-traversable, and unreachable areas.
- **Conditions:** Includes various scenes (woodland, farmland, grassland, countryside), weather conditions (sunny, rainy, foggy, snowy), and lighting conditions (bright light, daylight, twilight, darkness).
- **Access:** [ORFD Dataset](https://github.com/chaytonmin/Off-Road-Freespace-Detection)

### 4. USDA Forest Service Motor Vehicle Use Maps (MVUM)
- **Description:** Data on roads and trails within National Forest System lands where motorized use is allowed.
- **Details:** Includes vehicle type permissions and seasons of use.
